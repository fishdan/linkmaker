LinkMaker turns links pointing to `linkmaker` into live Wikipedia searches using the link text.

== Description ==

LinkMaker lets editors create Wikipedia links without leaving the editor. Link any text to `linkmaker` (no protocol) and the plugin automatically points the front-end link to the matching article on Wikipedia. It ships with lightweight JavaScript and CSS that only runs on the front-end when needed.

* Gutenberg-friendly workflow
* Zero configuration
* Keeps links that already point to GitHub untouched

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `linkmaker` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`, or install the plugin via the WordPress admin by uploading the ZIP file.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" screen in WordPress.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isnâ€™t my GitHub link changing? =
Links whose `href` contains `github` are intentionally skipped so developer documentation is unaffected.

= Can I force a different article slug than the visible text? =
Not yet. The plugin currently matches the Wikipedia article based on the visible anchor text.

== Screenshots ==

1. Linking text to `linkmaker` in Gutenberg automatically produces Wikipedia links on the front end.
